I don't really know the status of this code as compared to the proprietary
upstream version currently on the browser addon sites. If the community is
interested in maintaining this as a new project I'm happy to start a Github Org
for that purpose, or add contributors to this repo. I don't have much experience
with addon/extension packaging and distribution, but am happy to at least try to
keep the code working as well as I can.
